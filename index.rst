Webdev Bootcamp
===============

Perhaps you are familiar with Git, Django, jQuery, 
Python, JS, CSS, HTML, RabbitMQ, Celery and **the DOM**. 

Despite all that, web developing at Mozilla can still be
challenging.  
The *Webdev Bootcamp* is an attempt to clarify how things 
are sometimes done.

.. seealso::
   If you are doing Django development for Mozilla, 
   much of our Django behavior is encapsulated in 
   `Playdoh <http://playdoh.readthedocs.org/>`_.

   if you can do something better or if you think what's been
   documented is not right, challenge it and make life better for your
   webdev siblings.
