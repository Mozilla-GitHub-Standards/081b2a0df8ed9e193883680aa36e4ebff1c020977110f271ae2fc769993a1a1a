Accounts You'll Need
====================

Most of the Mozilla web development process takes place between Bugzilla,
IRC, and GitHub. There are some other accounts you might need too. Here's
everything you should request when you start at Mozilla:

List of All Accounts (and How to Get Them)
------------------------------------------

Use the links to each app to get to their signup form.

* *Email* and other communication accounts

  See :ref:`communications-chapter` for details.

* `Bugzilla`_ — use your @mozilla.com email to get 1337 access, and
  put your IRC nick or whatever you go by in your Bugzilla username
  for easier searching (example: ``Matthew Riley MacPherson
  [:tofumatt]``).

  See :ref:`bugzilla-chapter` for more details.

* `GitHub`_ — a free account is all that's required to develop on Mozilla web
  apps/sites.

  Ping ``wenzel``, ``jsocol``, or your manager on IRC to get added to the right groups.

  See :ref:`git-chapter` for more details.

* IRC_ — check out the wiki to learn about Mozilla IRC. You should
  register your main nickname on IRC so it doesn't get stolen and so
  you can access any channels that require you to ``IDENTIFY``.

  See :ref:`irc-chapter` for more details.

* Mercurial_ and ``svn`` — Sometimes things aren't in GitHub and you need to
  use ``hg`` or ``svn``. Locale files in particular are stored in Subversion
  for various reasons. Check out `Becoming a contributor`_ and be sure to ask
  for "Level 2 Mercurial Access".

* VPN — You'll have access to Mozilla-MV_ (office network) by default, though
  it does require some setup. Access to Mozilla-MPT_ is by request only however,
  and you'll need it.

  See :ref:`vpn-info` for more details.
